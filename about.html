                <p>This website was made for one simple reason: to give you something fun to do when you have a little
                    free time. Whether you're feeling bored, waiting around, or just looking for a quick distraction,
                    you're in the right place. Here you'll find a small collection of simple mini-games and a virtual
                    instrument. Everything is designed to be easy to pick up and play, perfect for those moments when
                    you just want to kill some time.</p>

                <h2>What can you play?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling competitive? Challenge a friend or go up against the computer in a classic game of
                        Tic-Tac-Toe.</li>
                    <li>Want to test your word skills? Try Wordsy and see how good your vocabulary really is.</li>
                    <li>Looking to sharpen your memory? Card Match will put your pattern-spotting skills to the test.
                    </li>
                    <li>More of a music person? Open up the virtual synthesizer and make some noise, no musical talent
                        required.</li>
